# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator program implemented in JavaScript. It allows users to generate random passwords with customizable parameters such as length, inclusion of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## How It Works

When the program is run, it prompts the user to enter the desired length of the password and select the character types to include. The available character types are:

- Lowercase letters (a-z)
- Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Numeric digits (0-9)
- Special characters (!@#$%^&*()_+~`|}{[]\:;?><,./-=)

Based on the user's selections, the program generates a random password that meets the specified criteria. The password is then displayed on the screen.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Generate Password" button.
3. Enter the desired length of the password when prompted.
4. Confirm or cancel the inclusion of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.
5. The generated password will be displayed in the text area on the screen.

Please note that the generated password is not stored or saved anywhere. It is solely generated for immediate use and is not stored or transmitted elsewhere.


## Compatibility

This program should work on any modern web browser that supports JavaScript.

Feel free to use, modify, or extend this password generator according to your needs.
